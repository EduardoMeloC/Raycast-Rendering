# Raycast Rendering
A simple raycast render made with LÖVE-2D, built from Pikuma's Course [Raycasting Basics](https://courses.pikuma.com/courses/raycasting)

The code structure was heavily inspired on the [BYTEPATH tutorial](https://love2d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=84886)

### How to execute it:
  * Make sure you have installed [LÖVE-2D](https://love2d.org/)
  * Enter the project folder and run "love ." on the command line.

### Notes:
  * This is a very basic implementation, with no textured walls and no camera shearing.
  * There is probably some unused code from the project template I created as I followed BYTEPATH's tutorial.
  * This was one of my first LÖVE-2D/Lua projects
